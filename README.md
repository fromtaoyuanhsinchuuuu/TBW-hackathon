# AssetFi: Real-World Asset to NFT Conversion

## Overview
**AssetFi** is a blockchain-based platform designed to transform real-world assets (RWA) into NFTs, enabling users to unlock value from their idle assets. The platform leverages Solana blockchain technology to provide a fast, secure, and efficient solution for managing asset ownership, control, and rental.

### Key Features:
1. **Ownership NFT**: Represents the ownership of the real-world asset. Only the owner can retrieve the actual asset.
2. **Control NFT**: Allows borrowing or renting the real-world asset. Controllers can re-sell control NFTs for additional profit.
3. **Renter NFT**: Represents the right to use the real-world asset for a specific period in exchange for rent.
4. **Lender NFT**: Provides continuous income from renting the asset, stored as metadata on the NFT.
